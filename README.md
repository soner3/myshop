# ShopZilla

An Online Shop as a final coding project for my course

## Start the Project

To start the project you have to run the following commands in the Terminal

1. npm run install
2. npm run build
3. npm run start

Error Handling:

1. Make sure you are in the correct folder in your Terminal. The path should have shopzilla in the end ---> "..../shopzilla"
2. Make sure you have node.js installed on your device:
   2.1 this means you should be able to run node -v and afterwards npm - v in your terminal
